Advanced Checklist Tool - User Guide
Welcome to the Advanced Checklist Tool!
This tool helps you organize and manage tasks with a hierarchical structure, allowing you to create main topics, subtopics, and add notes to each item. Here's how you can use it effectively:

Key Features:
Add Main Topic

Click on the "Add Main Topic" button to create a new top-level task or category.
You will be prompted to enter a title for the main topic.
Add Subtopic

For any main topic or subtopic, you can add more detailed items by clicking the three-dot menu and selecting "Add Subtopic."
This allows you to create a nested list under each topic.
Check/Uncheck Tasks

You can mark tasks as complete by checking the box next to the item.
Uncheck to mark it incomplete.
Expand/Collapse Subtopics

Click the "+" or "-" button to expand or collapse subtopics under each item.
This helps you view or hide sub-level tasks to reduce clutter.

You can update the text directly.
Remove Items

If you want to delete an item, click on the three-dot menu and select "Remove."
You will be asked to confirm before the item is permanently deleted.

You can add additional information or notes to any task by selecting the "Add Notes" option from the three-dot menu.
Notes will appear under the respective task.
Progress Tracker

At the top of the screen, you'll see a progress bar showing how many tasks are completed.
The percentage updates automatically as you check/uncheck tasks.
Saving and Loading:
